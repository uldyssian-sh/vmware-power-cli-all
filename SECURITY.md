- **Dependency Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of third-party dependencies
- **Code Signing**: All releases are digitally signed (planned)
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verified build and release process

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report Privately
Send security reports to our security team through one of these methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab
- **Email**: Send details to security@example.com (if available)
- **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### 3. Include These Details
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: PowerShell version, OS, and other relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue

### 4. Response Timeline
We commit to the following response times:

- **Resolution**: Target 7-14 days for critical issues

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
```powershell
# Always verify script integrity before execution
Get-FileHash .\Install-PowerCLI-All.ps1 -Algorithm SHA256

# Use execution policy to control script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Review script content before running
Get-Content .\Install-PowerCLI-All.ps1 | Out-Host -Paging
```

### Runtime Security
```powershell
# Use secure connections only
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Warn -Confirm:$false

# Enable certificate validation in production
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Fail -Confirm:$false

# Use credential objects instead of plain text passwords
$credential = Get-Credential
Connect-VIServer -Server vcenter.example.com -Credential $credential
```

### Environment Security
- **Credential Management**: Use Windows Credential Manager or secure vaults
- **Network Security**: Ensure encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access controls
- **Audit Logging**: Enable and monitor PowerCLI audit logs

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **User-Scope Installation**: No administrator privileges required
- **Secure Module Sources**: Only trusted PowerShell Gallery sources
- **Input Sanitization**: All parameters are validated
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure

### Security Configurations
```powershell
# Recommended security settings
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $false -Confirm:$false
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -DefaultVIServerMode Multiple -Confirm:$false
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Warn -Confirm:$false
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Initial report through secure channels
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop fixes
3. **Coordination**: We work with reporters on disclosure timeline
4. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix is available

### Recognition
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in security advisories (with permission)
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Eligible for recognition rewards (if program exists)
